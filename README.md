> **Note**: This is a demonstration version by LangGPT, based on the original Sequential Thinking MCP Server from Anthropic's Model Context Protocol. This demo showcases how to extend and publish MCP servers for the Claude ecosystem.

An MCP server implementation that provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through a structured thinking process. This server enables Claude to break down complex problems into manageable, trackable steps with support for revision and branching.

## Features

- Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- Revise and refine thoughts as understanding deepens
- Branch into alternative paths of reasoning
- Adjust the total number of thoughts dynamically
- Generate and verify solution hypotheses

## Tool

### sequential_thinking

Facilitates a detailed, step-by-step thinking process for problem-solving and analysis.

**Inputs:**
- `thought` (string): The current thinking step
- `nextThoughtNeeded` (boolean): Whether another thought step is needed
- `thoughtNumber` (integer): Current thought number
- `totalThoughts` (integer): Estimated total thoughts needed
- `isRevision` (boolean, optional): Whether this revises previous thinking
- `revisesThought` (integer, optional): Which thought is being reconsidered
- `branchFromThought` (integer, optional): Branching point thought number
- `branchId` (string, optional): Branch identifier
- `needsMoreThoughts` (boolean, optional): If more thoughts are needed

## Usage

The Sequential Thinking tool is designed for:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

## Quick Start

### Installation via NPM (Recommended)

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@langgpt/sequential-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Installation via Docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm", 
        "-i",
        "langgpt/sequential-thinking-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

After adding the configuration, restart Claude Desktop and try asking:
```
Please use the sequential thinking tool to analyze this complex problem step by step.
```

For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`.

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.

For NPX installation:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "sequential-thinking": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y",
          "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Docker installation:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "sequential-thinking": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--rm",
          "-i",
          "mcp/sequentialthinking"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Building

Docker:

```bash
docker build -t mcp/sequentialthinking -f src/sequentialthinking/Dockerfile .
```

## Local Development and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** (usually installed with Node.js)

### Local Build Steps

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This compiles TypeScript code to the `dist/` directory.

3. **Development mode**
   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

   This starts watch mode for automatic recompilation.

### Local Source Configuration for Claude Desktop

If you want to use this MCP server from local source code, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure project is built**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Locate Claude Desktop config file**
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

3. **Add local configuration**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "sequential-thinking": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/your/absolute/path/to/project/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING": "false"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Important**: Replace `/your/absolute/path/to/project/dist/index.js` with your actual project path!

4. **Restart Claude Desktop**
   
   After saving the config file, restart the Claude Desktop application.

5. **Test the tool**
   
   Test in Claude with something like:
   ```
   Please use the sequential thinking tool to analyze a complex problem
   ```
